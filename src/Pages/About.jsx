      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        After completing my degree in Computer Science I did a six month
        internship in C# (unity-software) in 2016. After this I had an
        opportunity to start working as a Software implemtation engineer where I
        worked in the radiology and pathology domain. I used oracle, pl/sql and
        java. I enjoyed working with the clients where I worked in a team to
        implement Oracle System according to the client requirement. I also
        provided training about the software to the doctors and their teams. In
        March 2018, I came to England, I have worked as customer asistant and as
        warehouse operative in music magpie always with the hope to restart my
        career in IT. At the start of 2020 I was able to make this happen, I
        started Bootcamp with Northcoders. I am looking forward to a career in
        web developer.
