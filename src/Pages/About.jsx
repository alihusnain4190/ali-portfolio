          After completing my degree in Computer Science I did a six month
          internship in C# (unity-software) in 2016. After this I had an
          opportunity to start working as a Software implemtation engineer where
          I worked in the radiology and pathology domain. I used oracle, pl/sql
          and java. I enjoyed working with the clients where I worked in a team
          to implement Oracle System according to the client requirement. I also
          provided training about the software to the doctors and their teams.
          In March 2018, I came to England, I have worked as customer asistant
          and as warehouse operative in music magpie always with the hope to
          restart my career in IT. At the start of 2020 I was able to make this
          happen, I started Bootcamp with Northcoders. I am looking forward to a
          career in web developer.
